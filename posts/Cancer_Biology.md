# Introduction to Cancer Biology

## Module 1: The Human Cell and Genetics of Cancer

### 1.1 The Nature of Genes and Mutation

Cancer is fundamentally a genetic disease caused by the accumulation of detrimental variations in the genome. A single mutation is rarely sufficient to induce cancer; it requires the accumulation of multiple mutations.

- **The Gene:** A discrete unit of heredity composed of a region of DNA that encodes a functional product (RNA or protein). Humans have approximately 25,000 genes.

- **The Central Dogma:** The flow of genetic information follows the path: **DNA → RNA → Protein**.

- **Replication:** DNA copies itself before cell division.

- **Transcription:** DNA code is copied into RNA.

- **Translation:** RNA is translated into proteins that perform cellular work.

- **Chromosomes:** DNA is packaged into chromosomes. Humans are **diploid**, possessing 23 pairs (one maternal copy and one paternal copy of every gene).

---

### 1.2 Types of Mutations

Mutations are detrimental genetic variations increasing disease risk. They arise from two main sources:

1. **Somatic Mutations:**  
   Acquired by somatic (non-reproductive) cells during proliferation. These mutations are passed to daughter cells but **cannot** be inherited. They arise from replication errors or environmental carcinogens (e.g., UV light, smoking).

2. **Germline (Inherited) Mutations:**  
   Present in germ cells (egg or sperm) and inherited by offspring. Examples include mutations associated with inherited breast or stomach cancer risk.

### 1.3 Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressors

Cancer genes are categorized by their function in cell regulation, often described using a car analogy:

- **Oncogenes (The Gas Pedal):**  
  Genes that promote cancer. Mutations are usually **activating**, causing inappropriate or excessive gene expression.

- **Tumor Suppressors (The Brakes):**  
  Genes that protect against cancer. Mutations are usually **inactivating**, reducing or eliminating gene function.

**The Two-Hit Hypothesis:**  
Because humans have two copies of each gene, one mutated allele is often insufficient to cause cancer. For tumor suppressors to fail, **both** copies must be affected.

## Module 2: The Ten Cellular Hallmarks of Cancer

Cancer cells acquire specific capabilities that distinguish them from normal cells, known as the **Hallmarks of Cancer**.

### Hallmark 1: Replicative Immortality

- **Normal Cells:**  
  Have a finite number of divisions due to telomere shortening (**Hayflick’s limit**).

- **Cancer Cells:**  
  Express **telomerase**, allowing indefinite telomere extension and division.

---

### Hallmark 2: Genome Instability

- **Normal Cells:**  
  Repair DNA damage using tumor suppressor pathways during the S-phase.

- **Cancer Cells:**  
  Harbor mutations in tumor suppressor genes, leading to accumulated chromosomal abnormalities.

---

### Hallmark 3: Evasion of Growth Suppressor Signals

- **Mechanism:**  
  Circumvention of the G1 checkpoint.

- **Key Players:**
  - **Retinoblastoma (Rb):** Inhibits G1 progression.
  - **p53:** Central regulator of DNA damage response and apoptosis.

---

### Hallmark 4: Resistance to Cell Death

- **Apoptosis:**  
  Programmed cell death used to eliminate damaged cells.

- **Cancer Mechanism:**  
  Upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., **Bcl-2, Bcl-XL**) and downregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bax, Bak).

---

### Hallmark 5: Sustained Proliferation

- **Mechanism:**  
  Deregulated growth factor signaling.

- **Key Players:**  
  Overactive oncogenes such as **RAS** and growth factors like **EGF**.

---

### Hallmark 6: Altered Metabolism (The Warburg Effect)

- **Normal Metabolism:**  
  Oxidative phosphorylation.

- **Cancer Metabolism:**  
  **Aerobic glycolysis**, producing lactate even in oxygen-rich conditions.

- **Imaging Application:**  
  Exploited in PET scans using radiolabeled glucose.

---

### Hallmark 7: Avoiding Immune Destruction

- **Mechanism:**  
  Cancer cells inhibit T-cell activity.

- **Checkpoint Proteins:**  
  Tumor-expressed **PD-L1** binds **PD-1** on T-cells, suppressing immune attack.

---

### Hallmark 8: Tumor-Promoting Inflammation

- **Mechanism:**  
  Immune cell infiltration mimics chronic inflammation.

- **Result:**  
  Cytokine and growth factor release enhances tumor growth and angiogenesis.

---

### Hallmark 9: Induction of Angiogenesis

- **Definition:**  
  Formation of new blood vessels.

- **Mechanism:**  
  Activation of **VEGF** to supply oxygen and nutrients; vessels are often leaky.

---

### Hallmark 10: Activation of Invasion and Metastasis

- **EMT:**  
  Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition enables migration and invasion.

---

## Module 3: Metastasis

**Definition:**  
Metastasis is the spread of cancer cells from the primary tumor to distant organs via blood or lymph and is the leading cause of cancer-related death.

### 3.1 The Seed and Soil Hypothesis

Proposed by Stephen Paget (1889): cancer cells (“seeds”) grow preferentially in favorable organ environments (“soil”).

- *Example:* Prostate cancer commonly metastasizes to bone.

---

### 3.2 The Metastatic Cascade

1. Primary tumor growth  
2. Angiogenesis  
3. EMT  
4. Invasion through extracellular matrix  
5. Intravasation  
6. Circulation as **CTCs**  
7. Extravasation as **DTCs**  
8. Dormancy or secondary tumor growth

---

### 3.3 The Ecological Paradigm (Cancer Swamp)

Harsh tumor environments select for aggressive, migratory cells—analogous to species leaving a collapsing ecosystem.

---

### 3.4 TNM Staging System

- **T (Tumor):** Size/extent (T1–T4)  
- **N (Nodes):** Lymph node involvement  
- **M (Metastasis):** Distant spread
