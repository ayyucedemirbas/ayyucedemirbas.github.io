# Introduction to Cancer Biology

## Module 1: The Human Cell and Genetics of Cancer

### 1.1 The Nature of Genes and Mutation

Cancer is fundamentally a genetic disease caused by the accumulation of detrimental variation in the genome. A single mutation is rarely sufficient to induce cancer; it requires the accumulation of multiple mutations.

* 
**The Gene:** A discrete unit of heredity composed of a region of DNA that encodes for a functional product (RNA or protein). Humans have approximately 25,000 genes.


* 
**The Central Dogma:** The flow of genetic information follows the path: **DNA  RNA  Protein**.


* 
**Replication:** DNA copies itself before cell division.


* 
**Transcription:** DNA code is copied into RNA.


* 
**Translation:** RNA is translated into proteins that perform cellular work.




* **Chromosomes:** DNA is packaged into chromosomes. Humans are **diploid**, possessing 23 pairs (one maternal copy and one paternal copy of every gene).



### 1.2 Types of Mutations

Mutations are detrimental genetic variations increasing disease risk. They arise from two main sources:

1. **Somatic Mutations:** Acquired by somatic cells (non-reproductive cells) during proliferation. These are passed to daughter cells but **cannot** be inherited by offspring. They arise from replication errors or environmental carcinogens (UV light, smoking).


2. **Germline (Inherited) Mutations:** Present in germ cells (egg/sperm) and inherited by offspring. Examples include  (breast cancer risk) and  (stomach cancer risk).



### 1.3 Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressors

Cancer genes are categorized by their function in cell regulation, often described using a car analogy:

* **Oncogenes (The Gas Pedal):** Genes that promote cancer. Mutations here are usually **activating**, causing the gene to be expressed at the wrong time or level.


* **Tumor Suppressors (The Brakes):** Genes that protect against cancer. Mutations here are usually **inactivating**, reducing the function of the gene.



**The Two-Hit Hypothesis:** Because humans have two copies of every gene, one mutated allele is often not enough to cause cancer if the other functions normally. For tumor suppressors to fail, **both** copies must be affected (the "two hits").

## Module 2: The Ten Cellular Hallmarks of Cancer

Cancer cells acquire specific capabilities that distinguish them from normal cells. These are known as the Hallmarks of Cancer.

### Hallmark 1: Replicative Immortality

* 
**Normal Cells:** Have a finite ability to divide due to the shortening of **telomeres** (protective ends of chromosomes) after each division ("Hayflick's limit").


* 
**Cancer Cells:** Bypass this limit by expressing **telomerase**, an enzyme that repeatedly extends telomeres, allowing indefinite division.



### Hallmark 2: Genome Instability

* 
**Normal Cells:** Use tumor suppressors to repair DNA mutations during the S-phase of the cell cycle.


* 
**Cancer Cells:** Often possess mutations in tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), leading to an accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities and mutations while continuing to undergo mitosis.



### Hallmark 3: Evasion of Growth Suppressor Signals

* 
**Mechanism:** Cancer cells circumvent the G1 checkpoint in the cell cycle.


* **Key Players:**
* 
**Retinoblastoma (Rb):** A TSG that normally inhibits passage through the G1 restriction point.


* 
**p53:** A TSG known as a central regulator of cell death; it arrests the cycle if DNA damage is detected.





### Hallmark 4: Resistance to Cell Death

* 
**Apoptosis:** Programmed cell death used by normal cells to eliminate damage.


* 
**Cancer Mechanism:** Cancer cells upregulate anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., **Bcl-2, Bcl-XL**) and downregulate pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bax, Bak) to survive stress and damage.



### Hallmark 5: Sustained Proliferation

* 
**Mechanism:** Cancer cells deregulate growth factor signaling to maintain homeostasis.


* 
**Key Players:** Over-active oncogenes like **RAS** and growth factors like **EGF** (Epidermal Growth Factor) drive continuous proliferation.



### Hallmark 6: Altered Metabolism (The Warburg Effect)

* 
**Normal Metabolism:** Oxidative phosphorylation (high ATP production).


* **Cancer Metabolism:** **Aerobic Glycolysis** (Warburg Effect). Cancer cells convert glucose to lactate even in the presence of oxygen. While this produces less ATP, it generates biomass necessary for rapid cell proliferation.


* 
**Imaging Application:** This hallmark is exploited in PET scans using radiolabeled glucose ().



### Hallmark 7: Avoiding Immune Destruction

* **Mechanism:** The immune system (T-cells) normally eliminates tumor cells. Cancer cells evade this by inhibiting T-cells.


* 
**Checkpoint Proteins:** Cancer cells express **PD-L1**, which binds to **PD-1** on T-cells, effectively sending a "suppression" signal that stops the T-cell from attacking.



### Hallmark 8: Tumor-Promoting Inflammation

* 
**Mechanism:** The tumor microenvironment is infiltrated by immune cells that mimic inflammatory conditions.


* 
**Result:** These immune cells provide cytokines and growth factors that increase tumor motility, survival, and angiogenesis.



### Hallmark 9: Induction of Angiogenesis

* 
**Definition:** The formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones.


* 
**Mechanism:** Tumors activate pro-angiogenic factors like **VEGF** (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) to create a blood supply for nutrients and oxygen. These new vessels are often "leaky," aiding metastasis.



### Hallmark 10: Activation of Invasion and Metastasis

* **EMT:** Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition. Cancer cells lose their polarity and adhesion (becoming less like stationary epithelial cells) and gain the ability to migrate (becoming more like mobile mesenchymal cells).



---

## Module 3: Metastasis

**Definition:** Metastasis is the process by which tumor cells move from the primary tumor to a different organ via lymph or blood. It is the primary cause of death in cancer patients.

### 3.1 The "Seed and Soil" Hypothesis

Proposed by Stephen Paget in 1889, this hypothesis states that cancer cells ("seeds") home to specific secondary organs where the environment ("soil") is favorable for their growth.

* 
*Example:* Prostate cancer commonly metastasizes to bone (favorable soil) but never to the pancreas.



### 3.2 The Metastatic Cascade (Steps)

1. 
**Primary Tumor Growth:** Uncontrolled division creates a mass.


2. 
**Angiogenesis:** Creation of a blood supply.


3. 
**EMT:** Cells transition to a mobile phenotype.


4. 
**Invasion:** Cells break through the extracellular matrix (ECM).


5. 
**Intravasation:** Cells enter the bloodstream (actively or passively).


6. **Circulation:** Survival as **Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs)**. They must survive immune surveillance and shear forces. Most die here.


7. 
**Extravasation:** CTCs leave the bloodstream at a secondary site, becoming **Disseminated Tumor Cells (DTCs)**.


8. 
**Dormancy/Secondary Growth:** DTCs may lie dormant or begin colonization to form a metastatic tumor.



### 3.3 The Ecological Paradigm ("Cancer Swamp")

This theory proposes that the primary tumor environment becomes toxic (hypoxic, acidic, nutrient-poor) due to overgrowth—a "cancer swamp". This harsh environment selects for aggressive cells that can migrate (metastasize) to find a better environment, similar to invasive species leaving a dying ecosystem.

### 3.4 TNM Staging System

Standardized system to determine cancer progression:

* 
**T (Tumor):** Size and extent of the primary tumor (T1-T4).


* 
**N (Lymph Node):** Involvement of nearby lymph nodes (N0, N1, etc.).


* 
**M (Metastasis):** Presence of spread to other organs (M0, M1).

## Module 4: Medical Imaging

Medical imaging creates visual representations of the body's interior for clinical analysis.

### 4.1 Imaging Modalities & Energies

| Energy Type | Modality | Mechanism | Key Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **X-rays** | Plain Films, CT | Absorption by tissue density | Bone looks white (dense), Air looks dark.

 |
| **Magnetic Field** | MRI | Alignment of Hydrogen atoms | Excellent for soft tissue and brain.

 |
| **Sound Waves** | Ultrasound | Reflection of sound waves | Used for liver, breast, fetus.

 |
| **Radioisotopes** | Nuclear Medicine (PET/Bone Scan) | Radioactive decay detection | Shows metabolic activity (function).

 |

### 4.2 Imaging Orientations (Cross-Sectional/3D)

* 
**Transverse (Axial):** Separates head from feet (like a loaf of bread).


* 
**Frontal (Coronal):** Separates front from back.


* 
**Lateral (Sagittal):** Separates right from left.



### 4.3 Clinical Uses of Imaging

1. 
**Screening:** Detecting cancer before symptoms (e.g., Mammography for breast, CT for lung in smokers).


2. 
**Diagnosis:** Supporting pathology (the gold standard) and guiding biopsies.


3. 
**Staging:** determining the TNM stage.


4. 
**Response Assessment:** Checking if tumors shrink (e.g., RECIST criteria).


5. 
**Monitoring:** Watching for recurrence (e.g., PET scans using glucose preference of cancer).



**Oligometastasis:** A state of limited metastasis (e.g., fewer than 5 lesions) where curative treatment may still be possible, diagnosable via imaging.

## Module 5: Types of Cancer Treatment

### 5.1 Main Treatment Modalities

* **Surgery:** Removal of the tumor. Curative for localized disease.


* **Radiation:** Kills dividing cells via DNA damage. Can be External Beam or "seeds" (Brachytherapy).


* **Chemotherapy:** Systemic drugs that kill dividing cells. Side effects (hair loss, nausea) occur because normal dividing cells are also hit.


* 
*DNA Replication Inhibitors:* Platinum agents (Cisplatin), Anti-metabolites (5-FU), Alkylators (Cytoxan).


* 
*Cell Division (Mitosis) Inhibitors:* Taxanes (Taxol - prevents disassembly), Vinca Alkaloids (prevent assembly).




* 
**Hormonal Therapy:** Blocks hormones (estrogen/testosterone) that fuel specific cancers.


* 
**Targeted Therapy:** Inhibits specific mutated proteins (e.g., VEGF, EGFR, HER2).


* 
**Immunotherapy:** Stimulates the patient's own immune system. Checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., Keytruda, Opdivo) block PD-1 or CTLA-4 to release the "brakes" on T-cells.



### 5.2 Specific Cancers and Treatments

**Lung Cancer** 

* 
*Localized:* Surgery (Lobectomy) + Radiation.


* 
*Metastatic:* Chemotherapy doublets (e.g., Cisplatin + Taxol), Targeted therapy (Avastin/VEGF, Tarceva/EGFR), Immunotherapy (Opdivo).



**Breast Cancer** 

* *Localized:* Lumpectomy/Mastectomy + Radiation. Adjuvant chemo (Adriamycin, Taxol).


* 
*Hormonal:* Tamoxifen (blocks estrogen binding) or Aromatase inhibitors (blocks production).


* 
*Targeted:* Herceptin (for HER2+ cancers).



**Prostate Cancer** 

* 
*Localized:* Radical Prostatectomy or Radiation.


* 
*Hormonal:* Medical castration (Lupron/Eligard) to lower testosterone, or anti-androgens (Casodex).


* 
*Metastatic:* Chemo (Taxotere), Bone-targeting radionuclides (Xofigo), Vaccine (Provenge).



**Colon Cancer** 

* 
*Localized:* Surgery is main treatment.


* *Metastatic:* Chemo regimens like FOLFOX (5-FU + Oxaliplatin) or FOLFIRI. Targeted therapy (Avastin/VEGF).



**Liver Cancer** 

* 
*Localized:* Transplant or Tumor Ablation (Radiofrequency/Ethanol).
